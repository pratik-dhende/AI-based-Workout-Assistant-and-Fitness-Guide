### Abstract
Health and Fitness play a vital role in our day-today life. This can be attained in many ways of which exercising is one. Performing exercise can help us maintain very good health, only if carried out properly and in a defined manner, else the repercussions may have adverse effects on our body. To tackle this issue, we have created a system that keeps track of body movements and provides us with the number of repetitions performed, if performed within the foundation of the model. Our system also provides audio instruction to the user when performing the exercise inappropriately, and with the assistance of the user's physical measurements and his/her diet, the system is able to keep track of the user's calorie intake and recommends a certain amount of calorie intake to be followed in order to achieve normal Body Mass Index in order to stay fit. The proposed system uses Mediapipe Pose Estimation Model to track body moments while performing the exercise.
